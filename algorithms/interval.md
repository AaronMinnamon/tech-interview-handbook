- Interval range frenzy:
  - Given 2 interval ranges, create a function to tell me if these ranges intersect. Both start and end are inclusive: [start, end]
  - Given 2 interval ranges that intersect, now create a function to merge the 2 ranges into a single continuous range.
  - Now create a function that takes a group of unsorted, unorganized intervals, merge any intervals that intersect and sort them. The result should be a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals.
  - Now create a function to merge a new interval into a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals. After the merge, all intervals should remain
  non-intersecting.
- Given a list of meeting times, checks if any of them overlap. The follow-up question is to return the minimum number of rooms required to accommodate all the meetings. [Source](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2016/07/12/meeting-room-scheduling-problem/)
