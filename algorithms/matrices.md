### Airbnb

- You're given a 3x3 board of a tile puzzle, with 8 tiles numbered 1 to 8, and an empty spot. You can move any tile adjacent to the empty spot, to the empty spot, creating an empty spot where the tile originally was. The goal is to find a series of moves that will solve the board, i.e. get [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, - ] ] where - is the empty tile.
- Boggle implementation. Given a dictionary, and a matrix of letters, find all the words in the matrix that are in the dictionary. (Going across, down or diagonally).

### Facebook

- You have a matrix of ints, if a row or column contains a 0, you should make that entire row or column values 0.
- Given an n*n matrix filled randomly with different colors (no limit on what the colors are), add up the total number of groups of each color - a group is adjacent cells of the same color touching each other.
- You have a 4 x 4 board with characters. You need to write a function that finds if a certain word exists in the board. You can only jump to neighbouring characters (diagonally counts too).
