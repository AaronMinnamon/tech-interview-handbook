### Airbnb

- In an Arrays of Arrays , e.g. given [[], [1,2,3], [4,5], [], [], [6,7], [8], [9,10], [], []], print : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and implement an iterator that supports hasNext(), next() and remove methods,( the essence lies in how you would access the elements).
- You're given a 3x3 board of a tile puzzle, with 8 tiles numbered 1 to 8, and an empty spot. You can move any tile adjacent to the empty spot, to the empty spot, creating an empty spot where the tile originally was. The goal is to find a series of moves that will solve the board, i.e. get [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, - ] ] where - is the empty tile.
- Given a menu (list of items prices), find all possible combinations of items that sum a particular value K.
- Paginate an array with constraints, such as skipping certain items.
- Implement a circular buffer using an array.
- Boggle implementation. Given a dictionary, and a matrix of letters, find all the words in the matrix that are in the dictionary. (Going across, down or diagonally).
- Given array of arrays, sort them in ascending order.

### Facebook

- Flatten an array iteratively and recursively.
- Given an input array and another array that describes a new index for each element, mutate the input array so that each element ends up in their new index. Discuss the runtime of the algorithm and how you can be sure there won't be any infinite loops.
