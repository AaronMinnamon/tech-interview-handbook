Coding Questions
==

These are questions you can think in your head or clarify with the interviewer. They may lead you to
discover corner cases you might have missed out or even point you to the optimal approach!

## General

- How big is the range of input values?
- What kind of input is there? Are there negative numbers? Floating points?
- Are there duplicate values?
- Are there any time/space complexity requirements/constraints?

## Array

- Is the input sorted?

## Strings

- Can I use some common data structure that can deal with strings efficiently?
  - [Trie](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trie)
  - [Suffix Tree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Suffix_tree)
- Common string algorithms:
  - [KMP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) for efficient searching of substring
  - [Rabin Karp](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) rolling hash
