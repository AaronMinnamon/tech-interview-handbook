- Write in words for a given digit. e.g. 123-> one hundred and twenty three.

- Compute the square root of x without using any existing functions.
- Given numbers represented as binary strings, and return the string containing their sum: add("10010", "101") = "10111".

### Uber

- Write a function that returns values randomly, according to their weight. Suppose we have 3 elements with their weights: A (1), B (1) and C (2). The function should return A with probability 25%, B with 25% and C with 50% based on the weights.
