- **Critical Rendering Path** -

## General Strategies

1. Minimize Bytes.
1. Reduce critical resources.
1. Reduce CRP length. TODO: Explain what CRP length is.

## Loading

- Minify, Compress, Cache assets.
- Browsers have a [preloader](https://andydavies.me/blog/2013/10/22/how-the-browser-pre-loader-makes-pages-load-faster/) to load assets ahead of time.

## Rendering

- Remove whitespace and comments from HTML/CSS/JS file via minification.
- CSS
  - CSS blocks rendering AND JavaScript execution.
  - Split up CSS for fewer rendering blocking CSS stylesheets by using media attributes.
    - Download only the necessary CSS before the browser can start to render.

  - Use Simpler selectors.
- JavaScript
  - JS blocks parsing. If the script is external, it will have to be downloaded first. This incurs network latency.
  - Shift `<script>` tags to the bottom.
  - Async:
    - Scripts that don't modify the DOM or CSSOM can use the `async` attribute to tell the browser not to block DOM and does not need to wait for the CSSOM to be ready.
  - Defer JavaScript execution:
    - There is also a `defer` attribute available. The difference is that with `defer`, the script waits to execute until after the document has been parsed, whereas `async` lets the script run in the background while the document is being parsed.
